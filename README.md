# **UFOs**

## Project Overview
This analysis allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Table filters were added for the city, state, country, and shape. Each detailed search provides an in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings.

## Results
This first item to appear upon entering the website is the heading and description, as shown below. Note the "UFO Sightings" button in the top left corner of the webpage will reset the search filters and data results.

As you scroll down, you will see a search engine with filtetrs, as shown below.

Each filter criteria will give you a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings. For example, I entered "us" under the Country category, and "circle" under the Shape category to get a list of UFO sightings in the United States that were circle-shaped.

## Summary
One drawback of the this new design is the direction of the search engine, which seems to run only one way. It can be fustrating to have to scroll all the way back up to the top of the webpage and reset all the filters/data results every time you want to adjust one category of the filered search. In light of further developemt, I would recommend first moving or adding a reset button to the bottom of the filer categories along with a button called "Search" that the user can click to begin the search once the filter is set appropritely. I would also suggest improving the program to allow the user to change search criteria and click the "Search" button again to yield different results.
